# Fraud-Detection
Implementation of credit card fraud detection using machine learning algorithms 

In recent years we have seen a huge increase in Fraud attempts, making fraud detection importantas well as challenging. 
Despite countless efforts and human supervision,  hundreds of millions are lostdue to fraud.  Fraud can happen using various methods ie, 
stolen credit cards, misleading accounting,phishing emails, etc.  Due to small cases in large population detection of fraud is important 
as well aschallenging.Data mining and machine learning help to foresee and rapidly distinguish fraud and make quick moveto limit costs.  
Using data mining tools, a huge number of transactions can be looked to spot patternand distinguish fraud transactions.
